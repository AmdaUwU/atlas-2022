	"description": "Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETHZ or ETH Zürich) is one of the two federal institutes of technology of Switzerland, along with the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).\n\nThis location was also temporarily used by the computer science & communication science faculty of EPFL to display their name, before helping ETHZ building their logo back along with a Swiss cross. The art was later destroyed by the Romanian flag. Attempts were made to repair the damages after the Polish takeover, but only a few fragments remained in the end.",
